# this file only implements a very restricted part of owl reasoning rules.
# if you want to extend these rules, take a look at apache jenas ruleset.
# the most interesting parts for us are:

# value restrictions that allow us to infer from a class to all its individuals
[valueRestrictions: (?c rdf:type owl:Restriction), (?c owl:onProperty ?p), (?c owl:hasValue ?v), (?x rdf:type ?c) -> (?x ?p ?v)]

# and equivalent classes, to teach synonyms
[equivalentClasses1: (?a owl:equivalentClass ?b), (?x rdf:type ?a) -> (?x rdf:type ?b)]

# (which is symmetric)
[equivalentClassesSym: (?a owl:equivalentClass ?b) -> (?b owl:equivalentClass ?a)]
